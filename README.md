# GQLSleuth

GQLSleuth is an open-source Python CLI for authorized GraphQL security discovery and
analysis. The project is designed to automate the evidence-driven investigation workflow
used by application security professionals while remaining deterministic and safe by
default.

> Use GQLSleuth only against systems for which you have explicit authorization. The project

## Current status

The repository is currently at **Phase 3 — endpoint discovery**. It provides the Phase 0 and
Phase 1 foundation, the centralized Phase 2 HTTP layer, and deterministic discovery of endpoint
candidates using a small bundled path list.

The `scan` command now makes conservative HTTP GET requests to the supplied endpoint path, when
present, and common endpoint paths on the same origin. It records HTTP responses and individual
transport failures as endpoint-candidate evidence. It does not submit GraphQL payloads or
determine whether any candidate is actually GraphQL; confirmation remains a future phase.

## Requirements

- Python 3.13
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)

## Installation

Clone the repository, enter its directory, and synchronize the locked environment:

```bash
uv sync --locked
```

Show the available commands:

```bash
uv run gqlsleuth --help
```

## Current commands

Display the installed version:

```bash
uv run gqlsleuth version
```

Run safe endpoint candidate discovery with the default mode:

```bash
uv run gqlsleuth scan https://example.com
```

Choose a mode explicitly:

```bash
uv run gqlsleuth scan https://example.com --mode safe
uv run gqlsleuth scan https://example.com --mode active
```

ACTIVE performs the same safe GET-only endpoint discovery as SAFE during Phase 3. It does not
enable active-only behavior.

## Configuration

Phase 1 has one application setting, `mode`, with supported values `safe` and `active`. SAFE
is the built-in default. The initial implementation accepts configuration only through the
explicit `--mode` CLI option and this safe default.

Environment variables and configuration files are not supported yet. They remain deferred
until the project has enough settings to justify multiple configuration sources.

The module entry point exposes the same CLI:

```bash
uv run python -m gqlsleuth --help
```

## Development

Install the locked runtime and development dependencies:

```bash
uv sync --locked
```

Run the project checks:

```bash
uv run ruff format --check .
uv run ruff check .
uv run mypy src
uv run pytest
```

The complete project scope, architecture, safety constraints, and roadmap are documented in
[`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).
