# GQLSleuth

GQLSleuth is an open-source Python CLI for authorized GraphQL security discovery and
analysis. The project is designed to automate the evidence-driven investigation workflow
used by application security professionals while remaining deterministic and safe by
default.

> [!WARNING]
> Use GQLSleuth only against systems for which you have explicit authorization. The project
> is not intended for unauthorized access, destructive testing, brute force, exploitation,
> or service disruption.

## Current status

The repository is currently at **Phase 0 — Project scaffold**. It provides the Python
package, Typer command structure, Rich terminal output, development tooling, tests, and CI
foundation.

Scanning and network behavior are not implemented yet. The `scan` command is a placeholder
that exits successfully after clearly reporting that it performed no scan and made no
network request.

## Requirements

- Python 3.13
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)

## Installation

Clone the repository, enter its directory, and synchronize the locked environment:

```bash
uv sync --locked
```

Show the available commands:

```bash
uv run gqlsleuth --help
```

## Current commands

Display the installed version:

```bash
uv run gqlsleuth version
```

Run the Phase 0 placeholder command:

```bash
uv run gqlsleuth scan https://example.com
```

The module entry point exposes the same CLI:

```bash
uv run python -m gqlsleuth --help
```

## Development

Install the locked runtime and development dependencies:

```bash
uv sync --locked
```

Run the project checks:

```bash
uv run ruff format --check .
uv run ruff check .
uv run mypy src
uv run pytest
```

The complete project scope, architecture, safety constraints, and roadmap are documented in
[`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).
